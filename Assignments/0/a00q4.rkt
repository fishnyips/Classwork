;; Academic Integrity Acknowledgement Form
;; CS 115 -- Fall 2019 (Assignment 00 Question 4)
;;
;; This form is adapted from forms provided by the Office of Academic
;; Integrity as an educational tool to help students maintain high
;; standards of academic integrity (AI) in their work. The original
;; versions are available online at:
;; http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infoacad/AI_Acknowledgement_Forms/index.html.
;;
;; Students are expected to know what constitutes AI, to avoid committing
;; academic offences, and to take responsibility for their actions.
;;
;; Students who are unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who
;; need help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating)
;; or about 'rules' for group work / collaboration should seek guidance
;; from the course professor(s), tutor(s) or IA(s), TA(s), academic
;; advisor(s), or the Undergraduate Associate Dean.
;;
;; For information on categories of offences and types of penalties,
;; students should refer to Policy 71, Student Discipline,
;; http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy71.htm
;;
;; A student who believes that he/she has a ground to appeal a discipline
;; decision should refer to Policy 72, Student Appeals,
;; http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy72.htm
;;
;; A student who believes that a decision or action of a faculty member has
;; been unfair or unreasonable should refer to Policy 70, Student Petitions
;; and Grievances,
;; http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy70.htm
